# Semantic_Web_Mining_Social_Media_Scraping
The aim of this project is to gather data from various social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. We will be using specific search criteria to extract information using the platforms' search functionality. By leveraging this approach, we can obtain a vast amount of data relevant to our project goals.

Our project aims to collect a diverse range of content across these social media platforms, including user IDs, post or tweet content, likes, shares, comments, retweets, hyperlinks, hashtags, timestamps, and upvotes. We will be utilizing efficient scraping solutions based on recent research to extract this information in a timely and accurate manner.

To achieve our goals, we will be using several popular web scraping tools such as Octoparse, Reaper, Selenium, and Scrapy. These tools provide a wide range of features that allow us to scrape the required data from social media platforms efficiently.
